### Next, copy in your strip_punctuation function and define a function called get_pos which takes one parameter, a string which represents one or more sentences, and calculates how many words in the string are considered positive words. Use the list, positive_words to determine what words will count as positive. The function should return a positive integer - how many occurrences there are of positive words in the text. Note that all of the words in positive_words are lower cased, so youâ€™ll need to convert all the words in the input string to lower case as well.


punctuation_chars = ["'", '"', ",", ".", "!", ":", ";", '#', '@']
# list of positive words to use
positive_words = []
with open("positive_words.txt") as pos_f:
    for lin in pos_f:
        if lin[0] != ';' and lin[0] != '\n':
            positive_words.append(lin.strip())

def strip_punctuation(word):
    New_word=""  
    print("Word is: ",word)
    for w in word:
        if w not in punctuation_chars:
            New_word=New_word+w
    return  New_word


def get_pos(sentences):
    lower_string=sentences.lower()                    ## As the list of positive words are in lower case
    str_punc_removed=strip_punctuation(lower_string)  ##For Punctuation Removal
    print("str_punc_removed:",str_punc_removed)
    splitted_string=str_punc_removed.split()          ## For splitting the sentence into words
    print ("splitted_string:",splitted_string)
    
    
    pos_count=0
    for w in splitted_string:
        if w in positive_words:
            pos_count=pos_count+1
    return pos_count
