##To start, define a function called strip_punctuation which takes one parameter, a string which represents a word, and removes characters considered punctuation from everywhere in the word. (Hint: remember the .replace() method for strings.)


punctuation_chars = ["'", '"', ",", ".", "!", ":", ";", '#', '@']

def strip_punctuation(word):
    New_word=""  
    print("Word is: ",word)
    for w in word:
        if w not in punctuation_chars:
            New_word=New_word+w
    return New_word
